## Warning: Bad Writing Incoming

I got some pizza today, but it wasn’t the pizza that was satisfying. 

####TLDR: 

There was no “free” pizza; I needed to **actually do something** to earn it, and it was harder than it seemed.

####The Story:

A friend and I walk out of our study room. He’s hungry. We smell pizza. We see pizza. We want pizza. It’s simple, we get the pizza.

Except… There was for a seminar of professors having a discussion in the large room. This was no “free” pizza, but “earn by listening for 2 hours” pizza.

>“Yo Edward, I know if we just walk in with confidence they won’t even think anything of us.”

>“Go in there then! You’re the hungry one! **No one will care!**”

>“**I can’t. Not with those people watching.** If you don’t care so much, why don’t you go in an grab me a piece?”

>“Sure, why not. **No one will care.**”

Started to walk towards to room. Suddenly, it hit me. 

Now I’ll be honest, if someone were to tell me of how a dumb ass couldn’t walk into a room and get himself some free pizza, I would think he’s an unconfident coward. Fun fact, actually **doing** it shined a completely different light on the topic. I can say and motivate anyone to go do anything, because I’m not the one **doing** it. It’s ALWAYS easier said than done. 

What would those people think of me? These are professors, if they see me later in the week they might remember my cheap, free-loading self and immediately think I’m a scrub. What if they call me out, what if this, what if that. Why am I even doing this, I’m not the one who even wants the pizza.

Without even thinking, all of these thoughts came into my mind. I could be as confident as a rodent who got the cheese from the mouse-trap when I was just talking, but when I started actually **doing** stuff, the feels happened.

Eventually I just said f**k it and walked straight in, ripped off a slice of pizza and b-lined straight back to the door. Glancing over I noticed this older professor look at me, and have me the biggest smile and thumbs up out of nowhere.

Why was I even overthinking? **No one did care.**

The only person who cared was me. I was creating all these made up situations that probably won’t ever happen. Worst thing that could have happened? I get called out, in which I promptly stuff the pizza in my mouth and say “opps, sowwee bout dat,” and trot away.

This was the second time I officially confronted my natural, shy instinct. Every time I say f**k it and stop caring about the small things, the result always comes out minor and no one even gives a damn. Out of the two types of people, the ones who care too much about what people think of themselves and the ones who don’t care about the small nuances happening around the, one idea remains the same, no stranger will care that much about what you’re doing, and even if you did something that caught their attention, you will be forgotten within seconds of it happening.  

My entire life I’ve been a human being. I’ve been a student, been admiring new tech, been reading on what I can do to better myself as a person, been thinking about my future. But none of that “being” can shine until I develop into a **human doing.**
