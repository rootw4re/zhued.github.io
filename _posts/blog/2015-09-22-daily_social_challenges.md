### Actions speak louder than words.

I've read so many damn blogs and watched too many talks on ideas of confidence, motivation, not giving a f**k about the small things in life, and having a positive mentality. But I really don't understand any these concepts unless I go out and actually do it. 

### Here is my situtation:

I'll just be very blunt, to the point, and harsh.

I've never been a good public speaker. I freeze when I talk in front of groups of people. I don't like raising my hand or talking during class discussions. I don't know how to just strike up engaging conversations with strangers out of thin air. 

I <s>want</s> **am going** to improve.


# Let's go.

Here are my experiences on daily challenges that I give myself to get me out of my shell.

*Thanks Josh and Alex for doing these challenges with me and improving together.*
