### Actions speak louder than words.

I've read so many damn blogs and watched too many talks on ideas of confidence, motivation, not giving a f**k about the small things in life, and having a positive mentality. But I really don't understand any these concepts unless I go out and actually do it. 

### Here is my situtation:

I'll just be very blunt, to the point, and harsh.

I've never been a good public speaker. I freeze when I talk in front of groups of people. I don't like raising my hand or talking during class discussions. I don't know how to just strike up engaging conversations with strangers out of thin air. 

I <s>want</s> **am going** to improve.


# Let's go.

Here are my experiences on daily challenges that I give myself to get me out of my shell.

*Thanks Josh and Alex for doing these challenges with me and improving together.*

## Day 1: September 13, 2015

##### Selfie with a Stranger

**First Try:** Failed, the guy didn't know what a selfie was.. nor too much English. He felt so confused and hostile.

**Second Try:** Girl saw me having troubles with the guy above.

> Girl -> "HI! Do you just need to get a selfie!??"

> Me -> "Yeah.. I just need a photo wi.."

> Girl -> "OK YEAH LETS DO IT!"

*Forgive the blur, MY HANDS WERE SHAKIN*









## Day 2: September 15, 2015

#### Selfie with a Stranger

> Me -> "Hey what's up? Can I ask a quick favor?"

> Byron -> "Depends on what haha"

> Me -> "Can I get a photo with you? For fun!"

> Bryon -> "Ha, well.. I guess sure why not!"

#### Random person takes a picture of you, then you lay face down on the ground.

> Me -> "Ok wait" lays down "now take the picture"

> Girl -> "omg what are you doing." laughs and smiles exchanged

**LOL THAT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE**

## Day 4: September 23, 2015

#### Picture with three random girls.

> Me -> "Hey can I ask for a quick favor?"

> Girls -> "Yeah! :)"

> Me -> "Can I get a photo of you three and have her take the picture?"

> Girls -> "Yeah! :)"

> Me -> "Wait really?"

> Girls -> "Yeah! :)"

I contemplated for almost 20 minutes before finally being able to ask. And it was so easy. @_@
