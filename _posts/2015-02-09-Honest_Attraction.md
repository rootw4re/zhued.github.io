# Honesty. Vulnerability. Polarization. 

Three characteristics that pretty much sum it all up.


When I mention attraction, I'm not here to specifically talk about how to pick up women or men, or techniques to start conversations at the bar or in the cafe, because that is not who I am, or what I'm good at.


This is my reflection on how to become a more attractive being, to anyone around you. How to easily point out the people that you bond well with, and to separate the people you don't want to associate with sooner. 


**Quick Disclaimer: I have not perfected being an "attractive" human being, nor am I even anywhere close. It's simply my ideas, and the start of my journey.**


I've always believed that keeping a neutral and balanced relationship with everyone that I meet was the main objective in all networking. Throughout my teenage years, I focused on being 'friends' with everyone. It eventually lead to me 'knowing' a lot of people, but I couldn't say I was closely knit to a certain group of kids.. I was in a sense a part of all groups. 


**The good?**
I learned to converse with all types of people and was acknowledged quite often everywhere. Also no one hated my guts.. which kept me out of trouble I guess.


**The bad?** 
I was never truly close to a certain group. Although no one hated me, no one was particularly interested in getting to know me either. And when I tried, it seemed too forced.


At the time I didn't know what I was doing wrong. Maybe I needed more hobbies, maybe I needed even more 'friends,' or maybe I needed to change myself to fit in better.


**I didn't need any of that. All I needed was to be myself.**

So cliche Edward...



# Honesty

When interacting with all these groups of people I focused too much on altering my personal experiences and opinions to match other peoples'. When people liked something that I didn't like or visa versa, I would pretend to have similar points of views. 

> "Dude you have to read this Buzzfeed article, its hilarious!!"

> *pretends to look at all the brainless gifs and trash writing.

> "Haha, yo that was awesome! So funny!"

*What the hell was wrong with my stupid ass.* 

Honesty is what will separate the people that you with vibe well with and the mouth breathers that you have no interest in meeting further.

If someone is going to judge you for your own opinions or actions, then they aren't worth your time. We can lie and distort ourselves in various ways to try and fit in, but in the end, being yourself is a whole lot easier than being someone you are pretending to be. 

####Intention and Investment 
These two are the key factors in honesty when connecting with people, or even determining your actions and habits.

Listen to these phrases:

> I have this job so that people can respect me. I share my successes to everyone so that I can feel important. I hook up with random people to know that I'm valuable and desirable.

What's the similarity of all of these thoughts? They all pertain to one's **investments** in the *perceived* context of themselves by *other* people.

Always check your intentions. Are you trying to **impress**, or are you trying to **express?**

Someone that is constantly kissing everyone's ass or enthralls in a woman's beauty or over compliments a man's success is **investing** in attempting to *make* people like them, not trying to *find out* if people are compatible with them.

Doing something with the intention to specifically increase the possibility of someone liking you isn't being honest to yourself, but rather investing useless efforts in painting a fake depiction of you to everyone.

**Invest in yourself.** Build your personal profile of ideals and lifestyles that you find enjoyable and proper. It won't come overnight, but if you are *truly honest* about yourself and investing in your future, people who share the same ideals and attitudes will come naturally and those who don't will fade away.

**But true honesty is only possible with it is unconditional.**

Expose yourself. Show your weaknesses. Find people that are okay with your deficiencies and will help you strengthen them.





# Vulnerability

I never wanted to show that I was vulnerable. It would reveal that I was weak or had differing opinions. My weakness and differences would make me laughable. I didn't want to be vulnerable, therefore, at times, I pretended to fit in.

This is just something called **insecurity**; not being honest about yourself; not showing who you truly are in order to secure your identity of how you want to be portrayed.

Unconditional honesty displays your vulnerable side, an area in one's identity that is most easily relatable and speaks the most about a person.

**Human's are attracted to other's rough edges.**

Everyone has their failures. Everyone has been wrong and/or embarrassed. Everyone sucks at something. It's how comfortable with being who you are and how you are improving that is key to vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability is NOT Weakness.

Most people think of a person who’s vulnerable as an individual who cowers in the corner and begs others to accept them or not hurt them. This is not vulnerability, its being **needy** or weak.

We want to think of vulnerability in a more broad way. Not just emotional vulnerability, but physical vulnerability, social vulnerability.

Vulnerability should represent a form of **power**, a deep and subtle form of power. A man who is able to make himself vulnerable is saying to the world, “I don’t care what you think of me; this is who I am, and I refuse to be anyone else.” He's saying that he doesn't need or rely on anyone's impressions, because all he needs is his own experiences and mentality, making him vulnerable to all judgment.


Think of it this way, there are two men. 

One stands tall, looks straight ahead. Looks people in the eye when he speaks to them. Says what he thinks and is  not concerned with what others think of him. When he makes a mistake, he shrugs it off, apologizes when needed, and learns from the experience. When he sucks at something, he admits it. He’s unafraid to express his emotions, even if that means he gets rejected or exiled. He has no problem moving on to people who don’t reject him, but like him for who he is.

Now, the second man hunches over, eyes dart around and is unable to maintain eye contact. He puts on a cool persona that is always aloof. He avoids saying things that may upset others, and sometimes even lies to avoid conflict. He’s always trying to impress people. When he makes a mistake, he tries to blame others or pretend like it didn’t happen. He hides his emotions and will smile and tell everyone he’s fine even when he’s not. He’s scared to death of rejection. And when he is rejected, it sends him reeling, angry, and desperate to find a way to win back the affection of the person who doesn’t like him.

Which one of these two men is more **powerful**? Which one is more **vulnerable**? Which one is more **comfortable** with himself? Which one do you think people would be more naturally attracted to?

**Stop trying to be perfect.** Stop trying to cover up your mistakes and impress so goddamn much. 

If there actually is something that is really impressive about you, people will eventually know about it without you bragging. That mystery in finding people's strength through their weaknesses is what stimulates a close bond between humans.


First impressions are essential in building relationships. Therefore vulnerability should be exposed at the very first sight of meeting anyone, not just to close friends or family. In order to do so, we need to be **polarizing** in our interactions.








# Polarization

I've had too many interactions that are just neutral and boring because I've masked myself with this mentality of trying to be this "pristine, understanding" guy, when in reality, I'm just pretending to be a boring guy that says "yeah, oh cool, wow, awesome" all the time.


To polarize is to gain **immediate identification** about people by exposing the honest, vulnerable side of you.

It doesn't mean you need to be an amazing speaker. It doesn't mean you need to be incredibly outgoing. It simply means that you speak and act what you feel, appropriately of course, and do not hold back because someone *may* think differently of you.

Remember: WHAT you actually say doesn’t matter; WHY you say it matters... **Intention.**

Let's say I have an urge to meet this pretty girl in class. I analyze and think of what kind of guys that she could be into *because I don't want to be rejected.*  I approach pretending to be her dream guy and spew out some arrogant pickup line. Whether she likes me or not, **she doesn't know who I am.**

Another approach. Let's say there are tryouts for an improv group in town. I'm afraid to make a scene and have people dislike me, so I'm quiet and boring the entire time, when really I'm very outgoing and perfect for the group. After the tryout, **they don't know who I am.**

The intentions in both scenarios is to find some sort of acceptance from random people, not to polarize them.

####Don't chase validation, but fulfillment.

When you chase validation, you 'need' something from someone. You need something satisfying in return. **This needy behavior is the bane of most relationships.**

Needy behavior differentiates a nice guy that finishes last and a nice guy that finished first. A pickup artist who wants to get any phone number and a genuinely interested guy. The friend-zone and.. anything but the friend-zone.

Being needy is one of the biggest repulsive factors. Constantly looking for validation if anyone cares about her and her wild weekend, or showing off how many phone numbers he has, or if they are friends with you or not. 

Instead, **chase fulfillment**. Fulfillment in finding the truth about their opinions of your honest self. This means you won't be liked by everyone; people will dislike and reject you. **And yes, it will hurt.** However, on the bright side, you'll have a much closer and satisfying relationship with the people that actually accept your weird ass and behave the same as you. **These people are the ones who really matter in your world.**

This fulfillment will come with polarizing interactions. Showing that you are comfortable with being honest and vulnerable IMMEDIATELY, and finding out if people are comfortable with you.

Polarizing may lead to being too upfront, a tad bit rude, a little bit negative, but these are never wrong moves, assuming that they are honest expressions of yourself and you are showing your vulnerability.

The beauty is that whether people fall in love with you on the spot or she throws a drink in your face or you get a middle finger... you’ve **succeeded**. You’ve found out the truth. Your curiosity is fulfilled and you can now decide whether you should move on or not.



# To end things off..

These three ideals correlate very closely to each other, matter of fact, they're almost the same concepts.

How attractive you are is based on your non-needy, polarizing behavior. Your non-needy, polarizing behavior is based on how vulnerable you’re able to make yourself. And how vulnerable you’re able to make yourself is based on how honest you are to yourself and others.

####Invest in yourself. Check your intentions. Be honest about yourself. Show that you are vulnerable and humble. Polarize interactions to build truly enjoyable relationships.
