# *Do one thing everyday that scares you.*

### Actions speak louder than words.

I've read so many damn blogs and watched too many talks on ideas of confidence, motivation, having a positive mentality, and not giving a f**k about the small things in life. But I really don't understand any these concepts unless I go out and actually do it. 

### Here is my situtation:

I'll just be very blunt, to the point, and harsh.

I've never been a good public speaker. I freeze when I talk in front of groups of people. I don't like raising my hand or talking during class discussions. I don't know how to just strike up engaging conversations with strangers out of thin air.

True, I've gotten much better than my younger self, but I still have a long ways to go.

I <s>want</s> **am going** to improve.


# Let's go.

My friends and I have decided to give each other daily challenges that will push us out of our comfort zone. Here are my experiences of those daily challenges.

*Thanks [Josh](http://joshfermin.me/) and [Alex](http://alexcampbell.co/) for doing these challenges with me and improving together. You guys are truly amazing friends.*

#### Ask a random person to take a picture of you, then you lay face down on the ground.

## Day 6: September 25, 2015

#### Try to get a girl to hold your hand.

Ok this one was SO hard; it took my like a good hour contemplating before I actually did it.

Basically you randomly extend your hand out and ask for her to "hold this for me real quick," and when/if they reach for it, just hold their hand and see their reaction. 

The girl was too scared but played it off cool like I was just joking with her. 

> "No, sorry, oh my god, if that's an insect I will seriously scream"

## Day 7: October 1, 2015

#### Get a picture with someone holding you up like "a little baby."

**First Try:** Would have done it, but had a test in 5 minutes so he needed to leave. 

**Second Try: Negativity was real.**

> "What the f\*\*k dude, that's wierd. F\*\*k off, I'm not doing that sh*t.

**Third Try:** Super nice guy! Photo below. 

> "Ok man! I hope I'm strong enough!"
