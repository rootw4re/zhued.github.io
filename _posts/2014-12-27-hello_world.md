Hi. How are you? I don't really know how to start these things. 

While fiddling around with building my website, the thought of starting a blog came to my mind.

I'm terrible at writing. Why did I even think about doing so? Why did I even start writing this post? I need to start writing better; maybe that’s why. I heard that being able to convey one’s thoughts through words is one of the best traits a person can have. 

I’ll even make this blog into some sort diary; jotting down my experiences as I journey through this thing called life. Sounds like a plan. 

Well, I better introduce myself. My name is Edward Renxi Zhu. Full bred Chinese. Was born in Corvallis, Oregon (don’t remember a thing about the place though) and then moved to Starkville, Mississippi when I was about two years of age. Fun times in the deep South, many memories and stories about my stay there. But my parents decided to leave as I starting preschool and developed this linguistic trait called Ebonics, very weird to have this trait when you’re full on Asian. Moved to Fort Collins, Colorado around 5 years old and pretty much grew up here; attended K-12 in the town. 

Fast forward to present day, I am currently attending CU Boulder majoring in Computer Science in the Engineering School. Third year student, as of the time I’m writing this, and expected to graduate May 2016. 

That’s it for this post I guess. I just wrote almost three hundred words. FOR FUN.  I hope I continue with this though. Later down the road I’ll be able to see how naïve and stupid I used to be. This should be fun.  Most people won’t even know about this blog, just me and my consciousness. That sounded catchy, I should name this blog something catchy as well…

Let’s make this blog about the evolving perceptions of my life and mentality.

Thanks for reading. Just my random thoughts, that’s all.
